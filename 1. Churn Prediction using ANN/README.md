# Churn-Modelling-with-Neural-Networks

This is a simple project that aims to predict customer churn (i.e., customers leaving a business) using a neural network. The dataset used for this project is the *Churn_Modelling.csv* which contains information about bank customers.

## Requirements
This project requires the following libraries to be installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- tensorflow
To install these libraries, you can use pip:
```shell
$ pip install pandas numpy tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
```
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Tayyab885/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/1.%20Churn%20Prediction%20using%20ANN
$ cd Churn-Modelling-with-Neural-Networks

```
2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
3. Open **ANN_Implementation.ipynb** and run the notebook.
